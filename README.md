# Life-expectancy-Project-
Investigating Life Expectancy Factors Globally

## Obejective
Life expectancy is a key indicator of a population’s overall health and well-being. Over the past few decades, global life expectancy has steadily improved, driven by advancements in medicine, public health initiatives, and living standards. However, significant disparities remain across countries and regions, influenced by factors such as prevalence of undernourishment, sanitation levels, and the burden of non-communicable diseases. By analyzing these determinants, we can uncover the challenges faced by different populations and identify opportunities to improve global health outcomes. This story aims to explore these relationships and provide insights into the factors shaping life expectancy worldwide.

## Analysis
Compare 1. Prevelance of undernourishment, 2. sanitation levles, and 3. non- communicable disease on how it affects Life Expecatancy. ( these 3 factors had the highest correlations to Life Expectancy).
Take a closer look at United States to predict future Life Expectancy trends. 
Draw insights on income group for high and low expectancy.

## Defining Questions
If sanitation levels are higher, then life expectancy increases?
If the levels of Noncommunicable diseases are higher, then the levels of injuries increase?
If countries have higher level of prevalence of undernourishment then shorter life expectancy can be expected?

## Criteria and tools
● Project folder follows industry standards in terms of structure and naming conventions.

● Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager.

● Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).

● All required libraries have been successfully installed and imported into each script.

● Python scripts are clean and easy to follow with headings and contents lists.

● All code is consistent (e.g., with the use of quotation marks and spaces) and includes
descriptive comments.

● All required data sets have been successfully installed and imported into each script.

● Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking
the top and the bottom of the dataframe.

● All column names are self-explanatory.

● All identifier variables follow the industry standard data type.

● Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have
been checked and addressed.

● At least 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights
to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.

● Data ethics have been kept in mind when dealing with data, especially in regards to
customer information.

● Data is finally put in a tableau storyboard using correlation graphs, bar graphs and choropleth grapghs to anser 
the defining question with a conclucion.
